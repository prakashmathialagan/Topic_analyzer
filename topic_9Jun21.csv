Leading Digital is a classic book on the subject of Digital Transformation.  Here is a full and in-depth summary to get you started, but this is definitely one for your collection.
Inside this executive summary you will learn:
A Summary of the Summary:

1)    Why bother with Digital?
Globalisation, shifting value pools, changing demographics are all major and important drivers of change. Bigger are the shifts happening in technology: – the Social Media explosion, mobile computing, and analytics, the rise of the smart phone and tablet, the emergence of Cloud networking and computing. The shifts in technology are massive. And it does not stop: – robotics (pervasive, not just in factories), machine learning, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, self-driving vehicles, the list goes on. All of these technologies are digital and all are enablers for a revolution in the way business is done.
Mastery or Victim?
Digital transformation needs us all to think seriously about how we can become a master of digitisation rather than a victim. Victim stories abound from print media to film, organisations that just did not make the move and finished up. Digital Masters use technology to increase profitability and as this book will show, they succeed at it, making 26% more profit than their non-Digital Master peers. More than 90% of companies do not do Technology for a living but that does not mean they cannot carve out a competitive advantage by making the most of the technology shifts going on around them.
Defining Digital Mastery
Digital Mastery is usiing digital technology to create a market or drive efficiency.
New toys vs Mastery
Anyone can buy new tools. Digital mastery comes from conceptualising possibility and executing brilliantly. The Digital tools are the “What” and the execution with great Leadership capabilities is the “How”. By creating a matrix of Digital capability vs Leadership capability we can see archetype organisations.

Digital Capability
A 2015 survey of 184 companies with revenues of more than $US 500m pa showed that Fashionistas and Digital Masters outperformed their peers on a raft of performance statistics. The measures were revenue/employee, fixed asset turnover and others. Thus Beginners and Conservatives underperformed on these measures.
Leadership Capability
The same survey showed that Conservatives and Digital Masters outperformed their peers on pure financial measures – Profit and EBIT.
Digital Masters are the standout on every measure
On financial measures they outperform 26% on the basket of productivity measures they outperform by 9%. It pays to be a Digital Master. The mix of Digital Masters varies by industrial segment. Segments with a large % of Masters are High Technology, Banking, Finance, Insurance, Telecommunications and Hospitality.  Lower segments were Pharmaceuticals, FMCG, Retail, Utilities and Manufacturing.  In any vertical you cannot afford to wait. To get started understand where you are today.  Are you a Fashionista, a Beginner, a Conservative or already a Master? To start your journey, know your start point.
 
2)    Build your Digital Capabilities
First; create a compelling customer experience.
Transforming the customer experience is the centre of digital transformation. Listening to customers has changed forever. There are solid reasons to transform your customer’s experience:
Digital Masters transform the customer experience through 4 steps

Then; make the most of the power of your core operations
Better operations create competitive advantage. Why is it that the Japanese could give competitors tours of their operations yet those competitors could not go home and copy what they had seen? Because merely copying a process or a technology will not cut it. Great core operations come from a combination of culture, vision, people, technology and process and can be a true source of competitive advantage that others cannot mimic. The opportunity to digitally transform your operations lies in the use of robotics, analytics, and virtualisation. In transforming your operational advantage there are 3 sets of dual paradoxes. Think about how you can make the six elements in the paradoxes work for you in your business. When you do, you can free yourself of the assumptions and pre digital age “that is how we do things around here”.
Finally; think about reinventing your business model
The need to do it is a product of digitisation itself. New competitors will attack your market share from completely new angles. The film processing industry is a famous example. The need for film processing evaporated in the face of digital images and via phones that took pictures. The new business models picked value via improving the image (think Photoshop), selling phones (iPhone) or selling advertising or social media (think Snapchat). How then should a film processor like Kodak have reacted? There was a need to find new value pools and a new business model. Digitisation has caused disruption in the Taxi business, the Publishing industry, the accommodation industry. There are five archetypes of Business Model invention:

3)    Build your Leadership Capabilities
Craft the Digital Vision for your organisation
A Digital Vision, to be effective, needs to be transformative. The authors surveyed executives in nearly 400 companies. 42% said that their senior executives had a digital vision and only 34% said it was shared with senior and middle level executives. In Digital Master Companies the figures were 82% and 71% respectively. So what are the steps to craft a Transformative Digital Vision?
First: Build focus:
Next: Frame the Vision:
 [if lte IE 8]><div id=""hs-cta-ie-element""></div><![endif]hbspt.cta.load(644390, '5f87257d-52ca-4fa6-8fbd-b235802abf58', {});
Next: Build a governance model that suits your organisation

Committees – will help co-ordinate and drive decisions

If your relationship with the IT group doesn’t work: – then something needs to change and fast. The IT – Business relationship must be strong to drive digital transformation. In “Digital Masters” there rating on the “Shared Understanding” metric between the business and IT was 32% higher than non-Digital Masters. Success happens when there is real collaboration between IT and the business…and the business and IT!  When the relationship is strong the IT – Business partnership will merge technical knowledge, product and customer knowledge and change capability into a single transformational force. Business moves at the speed of trust and if it is broken between IT and the Business you have a major handicap to a real digital transformation.
Reasons IT – Business relationships are broken:-
Any or all of these reasons may exist in your organisation and even be true. And if the IT organisation and business do not try to improve the relationship, nothing will change except everyone will get older and slower and the gains of Digital Transformation will belong to your competitors.
Capability 1: Improve the IT/Business relationship
Capability 2: Build Digital Skills
In the survey for the book 82% of Digital Masters are actively investing in developing digital skills. For non-Masters the score was 40%. Skills being invested in are Analytics and hybrid digital skills (Tech people who are business savvy or business people who are a bit tech savvy). Remember there is a skills race on. There is a massive shortfall of analytics specialists (of 4.4 million analytics roles created globally per annum it is estimated that only 33% will be filled). To meet the challenge organisations need to have a portfolio approach: – build (train), buy (hire), borrow (use partners) the skills necessary.
Capability 3: Build a strong Digital platform
This takes investment. Often the foundational investment does not have a direct payback and thus needs very senior leadership support. To gain a single non siloed view of the customer, rid yourself of “legacy spaghetti” and allow yourself the opportunity to scale the business according to demand, you need a solid digital platform to support you. If you already have strong enterprise wide ERP and CRM systems you have a great start. Great digital platforms need leadership including resilience, courage and patience. It means being ready to kill projects that will compromise the platform or are circumventing being part of the platform. Jeff Bezos of Amazon took a stick approach – he mandated that any new development had to follow a very strong set of standards/design rules and said in writing “anyone who does not do this will be fired”.  The discipline at Amazon transformed their business internally so much that in the end they could offer the platform and processes to customers. That platform became Amazon Web Services which today turns over $10bn US per annum and is over 10% of Amazon’s total revenue. Other leaders have taken a carrot approach offering cost reductions to business leaders in the organisation to those who use a new platform. Carrot or Stick, it takes strong leadership to develop and deliver a great Digital Platform in an organisation. The payoff though will be speed to market, great single customer view, analytics capability, personalised marketing and vastly improved customer experience.

4)    How to implement Digital Transformation
There are 4 steps to implementation
We need to Frame the Digital Challenge, Focus investment, mobilise the organisation and then sustain the transition.
Mobilise the Organisation:
64% of employees feel that Senior Management have not adequately engaged them to share the vision. To do this well we have to signal our new ambitions clearly, earn the right to engage, set new behaviours and evolve the culture.
 [if lte IE 8]><div id=""hs-cta-ie-element""></div><![endif]hbspt.cta.load(644390, '40b24b13-5694-46e4-bccc-a797d9ad0faa', {});
Sustain the Transformation:
Transformations fail because change fatigue sets in, unaligned metrics and KPI’s get in the way and it just seems exhausting and hard work. It is all too easy to slip back to the old ways of doing things. To sustain transformation do 3 things; build foundation capabilities, align incentives and rewards and measure, monitor and iterate.

Data Asset Management (DAM) conserves, curates and exploits valuable enterprise Data Assets – Enterprise Data along with their associated Services.  Data Assets are now widely regarded as important in driving business value.
Just as other tangible assets are monetised, Enterprise Data and Services have a fiscal value on the balance sheet.  Business Value is extracted from Enterprise Data and Services through Data Asset Management – driving Data Innovation facilitating the launch of new data products and services in the Data Economy – and Competitiveness Achievement Planning (CAP) which delivers enhanced operational performance and accelerated business results.
 [if lte IE 8]><div id=""hs-cta-ie-element""></div><![endif]hbspt.cta.load(644390, 'ee5ae340-84ef-4674-80a3-7b8503dccddf', {});
Every day, in every organisation, the massive volume and diversity of decisions and actions which are informed by analytics and insights derived from Enterprise Data – are increasingly driven by new and evolving Data Asset Management frameworks, data architectures and technology platforms.
In every industry sector, companies are in a race to accumulate unique data assets and develop data exploitation methods – before their competitive rivals outmanoeuvre, outpace and outperform them.  Those companies which do not see data as a core enterprise asset, or are unable to develop a Data Asset Management Strategy are in danger of decline – and ultimately risk business failure.
Data Asset Management (DAM) – Information Maturity Model (IMM)

Many organisations are now changing the way in which they design and manage their business and technology portfolios, plan, design and execute their Data Business Transformation programmes and projects – through Data Asset Management (DAM) – bringing a more successful and efficient way to continuously improve the daily execution and outcomes of core operations and processes.
Data Asset Management – when adequately funded, planned and organised – has the potential to generate significant business impact in every public and social enterprise through business strategy enablement.
Data Asset Management architectures, methods and techniques, Data Services and platforms support Data Innovation in the creation of novel data products and services, and can drive Competitiveness Achievement Planning (CAP) in delivering accelerated business performance.
Data Asset Management (DAM): –
Novel business models and data architectures can be created by assembling and integrating these new data Assets together in surprising and inventive ways – such as Social Intelligence, Lifestyle Analytics and Consumer DNA.
Data-driven features and functions are now possible such as micro-marketing and mass customisation – the specific tailoring of products and services that meet the unique needs of every individual consumer – are now easily achievable through Data Innovation, providing not only new means of generating competitive advantage and opening new markets, but also yielding radical improvements in operational effectiveness and accelerated business results.
Data Asset Management (DAM) – Information Maturity Model (IMM)

Data Assets – Enterprise Data and Services – are neither an abundant nor a readily available resource.  Data Assets may be decomposed into a vast array of scarce, unique, valuable and often hard-won Data Points and Apps.  Each Data Point is defined by its shared Metadata (format) and by its specific Content (values).
Data Point occurrences may be characterised as being either structured Transactional, Event-based data consisting of temporal (historic) and spatial (geographic), personal (demographic), locational (place), fiscal (monetary), conditional (status) and transactional (event) data item values – or described as unstructured text, image, audio and video stream data content.
Each Data Point is associated with its own specific set of applications (Data Services), sources, costs and benefits.  Just as businesses cannot participate in new data markets and economies without the necessary seed funding or capitalisation – similarly, those same businesses cannot generate new propensity models or pricing plans without investment in the data and algorithms to support them.
Data Asset Management (DAM) – Frameworks: –

Data Asset Management – along with the data architectures and technology platforms which enable and support DAM – contains of a set of Enterprise Data Frameworks which in turn consists of methods, techniques and processes to execute Enterprise Data Management tasks and decisions.
Enterprise Data Frameworks: –
Data Asset Management supports the key Enterprise Data requirements of velocity, voracity, and volume – enabling the transformation of traditional hosted local Enterprise Applications (ERP, CRM, DWH and BI) into a set of robust, resilient and reliable SMAC (Social, Mobile, Analytics, Cloud) Data Services available commercially from vendors – easy to procure, install, implement, use and exploit.
These new SMAC Data Assets are delivered over the Internet and hosted as public, private or mixed cloud services.  SMAC Data Assets must also integrate with Legacy Enterprise Solutions to be effective.  Some heritage corporate data centres may be reinvented – as private clouds providing existing legacy functionality through new and reconfigured SMAC Data Assets.
The enhanced capabilities and capacity released by SMAC Data Assets will not only yield radical improvements in operational efficiency, but also release further opportunities for strategic competitive advantage.
Competitor Advantage is driven by deploying Data Science / Big Data / Fast Data, powering Analytics and Insights, with API Services accessing Cloud Computing and other 3rd Party consumer platforms: –
SMACT/4D Data Technology Stack: –
New Capabilities from DataAsset Management
Data Asset Management, with its hybrid-cloud architecture and collaboration between open-source and commercial software, provides the mechanism for the proliferation of Data Services – presentation and process execution, data management and integration, analytics and insights.  All of this, however, requires significant investment.  Many enterprises are committing to this investment because of the new capacity and capabilities that the Data Asset Management approach releases.
 [if lte IE 8]><div id=""hs-cta-ie-element""></div><![endif]hbspt.cta.load(644390, '5f6bcc2f-984e-4c61-b06f-78057eca6c05', {});
Data Assets support data-driven Customisation features and functions in areas such as micro-marketing and mass customisation – the specific tailoring of products and services to meet the unique needs of every individual consumer.  Machine Learning algorithms increase accuracy over time, by processing more input data over many cycles to enhance propensity and predictive models.  Discovering what works under which conditions and for how long requires iterative experimentation, repeated over many system cycles.  Data Assets makes these trials more cost-effective to run both as scheduled and ad-hoc jobs – with the capability to modify experimental parameters ‘on the fly’.
In addition to end-user analytics for standard, recurring questions and ad-hoc analytics for ‘power users’, Data Services offer the possibility of accessing internal and external data markets that satisfy spot demand for new intelligence products and extended data consumption.  Visual and Graphical interfaces to internal and external data lakes empower data scientists and other key stakeholders to browse for and access new datasets in the same way as they might shop for commodities on any e-commerce site.  Data Applications that visually discover, profile, transform, combine and display both internal and external data, now bring the actual cost of exploring a new risk factor or commercial opportunity below the opportunity cost of failing to investigate the issue.
Many companies collect data that they then share with other organisations, perhaps after further processing – enrichment and enhancement (combining or ‘mashing’ with other data sources) or anonymization (scrubbing proprietary and personal identification information).  Some of that data may be of significant interest to their trading partners or to other interested parties in their supply chain.  Other data may prove commercially valuable to unrelated external organisations – including demographic data aggregators (Sky IQ, Experian, Dunnhumbey or CACI) – or government agencies.
Embedded analytics in applications encourage users towards planed and desired outcomes – for example, converting ‘propensity to buy’ into ‘purchase intent’.  These include next-best actions for call-centre agents, product placement recommendations, and progress metrics in mobile apps that drive goal-seeking – encouraging consumers to achieve specific outcomes, goals and objectives.
Data can now be procured as an on-demand service – provisioned and managed just like any other on-demand service.  Many companies – Social Media Platforms, Audio and Video Streaming Services, Geodemographic Information providers, Airports, Railway and Bus Stations, Hotels and other Media, Travel and Leisure companies – create methods for internal and external applications to obtain data on demand via automated Application Programming Interface Services (APIs) – cutting the cost of new and existing data stores and increasing the Business Value of Data Assets in numerous ways.

Data Asset Management (DAM) – Architecture Roadmap: –

CONCLUSION
Data Assets will extend the influence of algorithmic analytics and insights and so radically improve the outcomes of human decision making.  As managers incorporate more data into their decision-making processes, more problem / opportunity domains will have their embedded logic exposed.  Those choices once thought to be strictly the domain of human beings will become the province of machines.
This has already happened with consumer product placement recommendations, delivery routing, and credit approvals.  Complex applications such as algorithmic analysis of cancer-screening images in Data Healthcare which are largely experimental today – will become routine tomorrow.
